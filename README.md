## Dependents

To preprocess the raw fNIRS recordings, MATLAB R2016a or later is required. Additionally, MATLAB toolboxes HOMER2 and spm12 are required (https://homer-fnirs.org/, https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/). The folders containing those 2 toolboxes are included in this repository. R 3.4.3 or above is required for running the LMEM model.

## Repo directory structure

There are 2 folders named: 

Experiment 1 SPEECH vs NOISE
Experiment 2 SPEECH vs SPEECH-oppo


The raw data and analysis code used to generate figures and tables for experiment 1 and 2 are in them respectively. Each folder also has detailed readme on how to process the data and generate results described in the paper. Clone this repository and follow the instructions for experiment 1 and 2.
